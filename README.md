# SocialNetworkingApp
An app that allows users to register, sign in and post to their account. Whilst seeing other users' posts. <br />
This app is still incomplete <br />
This app is based on a rough model provided within a youtube video (from the following channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIHBIPape0dWHKANkivrcJw) but created through my own inititative, capacity and skill. <br />
It allows the user to sign in through firebase, permantly store information for the profile and post to the app with a date and time marked (also serving to chronologically list said posts) <br />
The app of course also includes the opportunity to view other user's posts. <br />
The app also allows the user to amend their own posts and information (and not those of others)
